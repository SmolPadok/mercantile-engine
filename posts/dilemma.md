..
i cried a lot this few days.

its always the dilemma between trying to do the things you want and the things you have to do.

the exam is 3 months from now and i'm barely catching up.

there's nothing left to do other than to sit on the computer and study.

i think i'm already losing my mind. i could not do anything else. my other abilities got dragged down with it.

i really can't. i have to leave everything for just this time.

i cannot afford to lose this opportunity. i'm staking my life for this.

i will be returning to my hostel in 3 days. hopefully i could get back to speed from here on out.
