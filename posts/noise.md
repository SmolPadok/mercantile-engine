i don't give two shits what anyone is doing with their lives or whatever documents you bring that has nothing to do with me.
i take whatever is good and leave whatever is bad.
i never trust anyone here. i have far more dearer things to come home to.
if you have the urge to go out your way and parade how bad this person is then you're part of the problem.

...
i've lost all interest in this community.
no soul left.
i guess i've grown up.
the good experiences arent enough to outweigh the worse, loud noise.
i don't want to associate myself with people having such compulsive attachments to these things.

...
its not a passion project anymore. its just business. a company. corporate.
just a market to tap and seep dry.
the charm just isn't there anymore.

...
i'm moving on to different things now.
i'm staying low, drifting away from this noise.

my mind has never been clearer.
