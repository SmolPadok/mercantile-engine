assessing my current situation.
im an a-level student pursuing automotive engineering
i have two months left for my trials and 4 months away from the final exam.
i guess i still have time. just barely enough time.

im not feeling comfortable about this. not one bit.
i have to give full commitment. i will have to learn to let go.

no one is waiting for there. im just chasing my own tail.
just fade away, and start anew.

perhaps i worry too much.
